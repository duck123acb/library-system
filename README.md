# Duck Library

A small little library system, that's it. <br>
I made this to test my c++ skilzz :sunglasses: :scream: :fire: :100: :fire: :fire: :sunglasses: :scream: :sunglasses: :scream: :scream: :scream: <br>
also im was bored :sob:

## Using the program
### books.txt
The books.txt file is all the data the main.cpp file runs on. <br>
A book in the books.txt file would look like this: Title^Id^Author^Pages^Genres <br>
Example: Danush Ramanan, The entire story^83730^Danush Ramanan^20^Autobiography <br>
The values are separated with a '^' because i don't many people have a ^ in a title of a book <br>
<br>
<br>

### Book.hpp
The Book.hpp has the Book class.

### main.cpp
The functions that this file contains are: <br>
- askInput();
- getRandomId();
- randomizeAllIds();
- loadBooks();
- writeBookFile();
- createBook();
- listAllBooks();
- getSpecificBookFromList(books.size() - 1);
- searchBookTitle("Dan");
- searchBookAuthor("Lo");
- searchBookGenre("Novel");

## comple and run

## Further steps
- im probably not gonna make a gui myself (but feel free to make it yourself!).
