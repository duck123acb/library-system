# Duck Library

A small little library system, thats it. <br>
I made this to test my c++ skilzz :sunglasses: :scream: :fire: :100: :fire: :fire: :sunglasses: :scream: :sunglasses: :scream: :scream: :scream:

## TODO
- make an adding books system
- make a search system by name and genre/type
- could maybe make an id randomiser
- and im probably not gonna make a gui myself (but feel free to make it yourself!).
