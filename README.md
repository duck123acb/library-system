# Duck Library

A small little library system, that's it. <br>
I made this to test my c++ skilzz :sunglasses: :scream: :fire: :100: :fire: :fire: :sunglasses: :scream: :sunglasses: :scream: :scream: :scream: <br>
also im was bored :sob:

## Using the program
### books.txt
The books.txt file is all the data the main.cpp file runs on. <br>
A book in the books.txt file would look like this: Title^Id^Author^Pages^Catagories

## Further steps
- im probably not gonna make a gui myself (but feel free to make it yourself!).
